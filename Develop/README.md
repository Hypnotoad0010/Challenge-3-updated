Module 3 Challenge

In this challenge I created an app that can generate a random password.

A window promp was created to ask what special characters the user would like to use to generate their password.

The user can decide how long they would like their password, if they want to add uppercase, if they'd like to add numbers, and if they'd like to add any special characters. 

When finished after the 3 questions the user will have a new random password generated.

Java Script was mostly used to make functions to make the app work.
